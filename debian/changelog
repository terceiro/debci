  * Reformulate generation of static content
  - Debci::Job: receive autopkgtest results
      - Reformulate HTML generation
      - Add new CLI `debci html`; deprecate `debci generate-html`
      - Deprecate debci-generate-index; individual package pages are now
        updated right away when results for that package arrive;
        debci-update now only updates global pages (home page, status etc)
      - move all the real logic inside Debci::HTML
      - individual .json result files and "debci log" files are not longer
        produced.
      - debci-collector has been rewritten in Ruby, and will now receive
        results from the AMQP queue and directly import them instead of saving
        them to autopkgtest-incoming for later processing.
        - Legacy jobs in autopkgtest-incoming/ are processed o upgrade.
      - The data/status/ files are now simplified. For history, we keep a single
        status file per day. Existing data is migrated on upgrade.
    This set of changes provides a good performance enhancement. For
    example, running the full integration test suite on my machine now takes
    240 seconds instead of > 300
  * Drop pointless ${shlibs:Depends} from package dependencies

debci (1.8) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * This release adds two major features that were developed to support
    triggering tests to speed up Debian testing migrations:
    * Added support for "migration tests", which are tests that run on testbeds
      of a given suite (e.g. testing) with some packages from another suite
      (e.g.  unstable).
    * Added an HTTP API for requesting test runs. This will be used by britney
      to test package versions from unstable against testing.
  * debci setup: pass --suite to testbed creation scripts
  * debci test: Extract autopkgtest calls into a central helper program
  * backends/lxc: drop the unstable → sid renaming
  * Add script to run a Ruby shell
  * Move enqueuing process to Ruby for performance reasons
  * debian/control
    * replace build dependency on dh-systemd with debhelper (>= 9.20160709)
    * Bump Standards-Version to 4.1.3; no changes needed
    * remove unnecessary Testsuite: field

  [ Paul Gevers ]
  * backends/fake: use month instead of minutes in the generated package name
    for non-existent packages
  * backends/fake: use rmadison get more up-to-date version numbers
  * Initial version for a page where one can see which jobs have pending
    results
  * Add retrigger end point to the API

  * New program: debci localtest. It can be used by users to reproduce locally
    the same test environment used in ci.debian.net.
    - autopkgtest calls make by backends/*/test-package will now use the

  * debci setup
    - add -f/--force option to force an update, ignoring the testbed timestamp
  * web UI
    - fix links to packages in "status alerts" page
  * packaging:
    + debci-worker: move `apt-cacher-ng` from Recommends: to Suggests:. In
      practice, workers should usually be close to a good mirror; having a
      local cache increases the maintaince burden as the disk usage might go
      too high.
  * lxc backend:
    + drop "adt-sid-amd64-" prefix from container names. In practice,
      container names longer than 64 characters cause problems.
  * setup-chdist:
    + drop usage of timestamp to control when to call `apt-get update`. Just
      update always. an `apt-get update` on a updated tree should be quick
      enough.

debci (1.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * bin/debci-migrate.d/002_compress_artifacts: also remove directories after
    compressing artifacts
  * Web UI:
    - include version numbers almost everywhere.
  * lib/debci/html/package.erb: avoid crashing when installing a fresh system
    with no data, but with packages already blacklisted.
  * debian/debci.postrm: remove /var/log/debci on purge (Closes: #810701)
  * Add support for running tests for multiple suites (See: #831975).
    .
    Not that we couldn't do that already, but it would require specific
    workers for each suite. With these changes, a worker node for a given
    architecture can now run tests on any suite for that architecture.
    .
    - debci-worker will now expect the suite name as a second argument on test
      jobs (defaulting to whatever is in $debci_suite).
    - debci-enqueue will now send the suite name as a second argument on each
      test job
    - Added debci-update-worker as a wrapper for callling debci-setup for each
      supported suite.
  * backends/lxc:
    - retry `apt-get update` until it works. Most of the time when the testbed
      setup fails on production is during `apt-get update`.
  * "Platform-Specific issues" will now not consider tmpfail as an issue.
    Those are already being tracked by "Status alerts".
  * test/test_shell_best_practices.sh: start checking scripts with shellcheck;
    not failing on issues just yet.

  [ Gordon Ball ]
  * Add the concept of failure states, to distinguish between
    * tests which have never passed
    * tests which passed for a previous version, but never for the current
      version
    * tests which previously passed for the current version

debci (1.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debci-collector:
    - remove creation of .timestamp files under data/autopkgtest-incoming/,
      which are no longer used for anything
  * bin/debci-batch:
    - use one tmp_dir per package/suite/architecture
  * bin/debci-generate-index
    - use one tmp_dir per package/suite/architecture
    - compress artifacts (except log) in a single tarball so that instead of N
      files per test run, we only keep 2 files per test run: log.gz and
      artifacts.tar.gz. This should significantly reduce the usage of inodes.

debci (1.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * debian/debci-worker@.service: also bump LimitNPROC to infinity to avoid
    the `Cannot fork` issue.
  * backends/lxc/test-package: use adt-virt-lxc --name option to facilitate
    mapping from a running test to package names. This requires autopkgtest
    (>= 3.20).
  * bin/debci-collector, bin/debci-worker, lib/functions.sh#report_status:
    display suite and architecture together with package names
  * HTML UI:
    * add page listing Platform-specific issues, i.e. packages that passes on
      one suite/arch but fails on another suite/arch.
    * fix Status page to not hide all charts when any platform does not have
      enough data
    * rewrite Status charts page. In special, instead of loading the full
      history via AJAX, which takes quite a while, embed a reduced view of the
      data in the HTML itself.
    * remove search functionality: it was too heavy/slow. If one day the UI
      stops being only static HTML, we can a search feature again.
  * Drop debian/tests/worker-max-processes. The original issue was caused by
    (and fixed in) systemd >= 228 (see bug #823530), and the test ended up not
    being very reliable and keeps flapping on CI.
  * bin/debci-generate-index: remove call to debci-generate-html, since
    debci-update now call both debci-generate-index and debci-generate-html

  [ Jakub Wilk ]
  * public/style.css: Set correct font for alert, chart, rss, and tracker
    icons. (Closes: #821932)

  * HTML UI: fix final copyright year in the footer

debci (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/tests/control: restrict backend-schroot to only running on VMs
    (i.e. not on containers)
  * debian/debci-worker@.service: make sure there is no maximum number of
    processes; otherwise when using the lxc backend, we might get random
    failures saying `Cannot fork: resource temporarily unavailable` with
    systemd from stretch onwards.
    - added debian/tests/worker-max-processes as a test case
  * Add new backend `null`, which just uses the `null` virtualization regime
    in adt-run. This will be useful for running tests, but can also be used
    for running tests with zero overhead on trusted packages.
  * backends/fake: add support for executing an specific command instead of
    producing a random result if $DEBCI_FAKE_COMMAND is set.

  * backends/lxc/create-testbed: initialize $GUEST_PROXY before use, for the
    case when no proxy is detected.
  * Add integration tests for schroot and lxc backends
  * debian/tests/integration-test: wait until test jobs have been processed,
    to avoid failures due to not waiting long enough on slow machines.
  * debian/tests/control: force throwing away used testbed after
    integration-test and multiarch-integration-test

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Sun, 27 Mar 2016 22:42:29 -0300

debci (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  New features:

  * debci-config: added option to output only values and not keys
  * Proper support for multiple architectures.
    - list of architectures is declared in the configuration file using the
      `debci_arch_list` variable.
    - new script debci-update will call debci-generate-index for each of the
      architectures in $debci_arch_list, and them call debci-generate-html
      which was already architecture-independent.
    - systemd unit files debci-generate-index.{service,timer} renamed to
      debci-update.{service,timer}. debci-update.service and changed to call
      `debci update` instead of `debci generate-index`.

  Bug fixes:

  * remove unused debian/po directory (Closes: #813447)
  * test_helper: stop rabbitmq-server the right way

  Minor packaging updates:

  * remove deprecated and unused tools
  * debian/control: Use https URLs in Vcs-* fields

debci (1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * This is a major overhaul of the debci infrastructure. debci now works as a
    distributed system, with one or more workers that process test runs, and
    one central node that collects tests results and generates the HTML web
    UI. The nodes communicate using an AMQP server (usually rabbitmq-server),
    and test requests can be submitted from any host that can connect to the
    AMQP server. One will usually have one specific node, perhaps the one that
    runs the result collection/web UI, running `debci batch` to schedule tests.
  * New packages:
    + debci-worker: contains the systemd service units necessary to run the
      worker daemons; must be installed on worker nodes.
    + debci-collector: contains the systemd service unit necessary to run the
      debci collector daemon: will receive test results, and generate the HTML
      web interface; must be installed on a single node in the network
  * The `debci` package contains the debci core, and is still the package that
    needs to be installed for developers trying out debci locally as
    instructed the documentation.
  * Change default backend to `lxc`

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Initial implementation of the master/worker setup
  * Add support for importing data from test runs executed elsewhere

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * debci-migrate: added a data migration mechanism that is also automatically

  * Switch data storage strategy to compress all autopkgtest logs. This will
    save huge amounts of storage space.
    - tools/server.sh adjusted to make lighttpd serve *.log.gz files as
      regular text/plain files, but with the propers headers to tell browsers
      that they are compressed so they will do the right tihng.
  * debci-batch: will now stop even in the middle of a iteration when told to
    go offline.
  * backends/schroot/create-testbed, debci-setup-chdist: add buildd suites to
    sources.list so we detect newly uploaded packages faster
  * Removed embedded copy of Bootstrap, now depending on libjs-bootstrap

    instead of only exact matches when looking for source packages with test
    suites. This will allow detecting packages with specialized values such as
    autopkgtest-pkg-ruby and autopkgtest-pkg-perl.

  * debci-batch: store offline mark in persistent storage to avoid going back
    online after a reboot.
  * debci-test: revert to updating only package-specific data; it turns out
    that updating global data after every package is too expensive.
  * debci-batch: update global data every 1 hour or so

  * Fix calculation of test elapsed time. We can't store the beginning
    timestamp at the adt-run output directory because that will be wiped out
    by adt-run before running the test.
  * public/index.html: fix source code URL to point to the collab-main
    repository which is the canonical one.

debci (0.7.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix handling of blame with "unknown" as value. Will avoid crashing when
    generating indexes

debci (0.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * debci-batch: put packages with fastest testsuites first in the queue
  * debci-generate-feeds: allow generating feeds for specific packages
  * debci-generate-index: update package feed right away when indexing
    individual packages
  * public/app.js: Adjust the "Pass percentage" Y axis labels so that chart is
    actually a percentage chart.
  * public/index.html: add link to global Atom feed in the home page.
  * debci-test, debci-generate-index: more robust way of calculating test run
    duration. Parsing the autopkgtest log is just not good enough.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Fix report_status() to work for bash scripts.
  * debci-test: Add --print-output option to write output directory to stdout.
    With that the caller can easily check the result.
  * debci, tools/server.sh: Exec the target program instead of running in a
    subprocess, for efficiency and proper SIGTERM handling.
  * Drop tools/convert-data. We only needed it for version 0.6, and we're
    going to need a different conversion script after the next data/ dir
    reorganization.
  * Reorganize data directory to move the "categories" packages/,
    autopkgtest/, status/, and feeds/ to the top level; they contain
    subdirs for all releases and architectures. This makes autopkgtest/ fully
    rsyncable and also makes it easier to the web UI to browse/present data
    for multiple releases and architectures. Also split release-arch/ into
    release/arch/.
  * Add tools/convert-data-0.7: Convert data directory to changed format from
    above.
  * Fix debci-status -l if there is just one package.
  * Add tests for debci-batch, covering skipping/re-running of tests under
    appropriate conditions and showing the cause for re-run in the log.
  * Replace test/json_validity (in ruby) with test/test_json.sh (shell with
    just calling ruby for the actual JSON validation). With that we can re-use
    test_helper's test bed setup instead of having to replicate it all in
    ruby.
  * Make test/runall.sh executable for convenience, and make it only run
    test_* scripts.
  * debci-batch: remove reading configuration from /etc/default/debci
  * lib/environment.sh: read configuration from $debci_basedir/config/debci.conf
  * Add debci_mirror config variable to configure an archive mirror. Use it
    for chdist and schroot setup.
  * Drop unnecessary faketime build dependency.
  * Add LXC backend.

debci (0.6.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian-status: avoid generating invalid JSON in the presence of packages
    without status files

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Thu, 29 May 2014 12:48:48 -0300

debci (0.6.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debci-generate-index: don't try merging dependencies diff when no package
    has been blamed before.

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Wed, 28 May 2014 18:14:06 -0300

debci (0.6.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix chdist calls on stable (See #736504)

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Thu, 15 May 2014 12:51:25 -0300

debci (0.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Move schroot creation from bin/debci-setup to
    backends/schroot/create-testbed, as it is schroot backend specific and
    other backends will need different setup.
  * process-package: Call backend test-package with second argument that
    specifies the adt-run output directory. Implement that in schroot backend
    with adt-run --output-dir, and fake backend when passing $DEBCI_FAKE_DEPS.
    This will be used to collect and present log files, artifacts,
    package/version lists, etc.
  * Eliminate list-base-system and use autopkgtest's testbed-packages output
    file instead. This will also work with remote workers and other virt
    servers.
  * Eliminate check_version() and take this information from autopkgtest's
    output.
  * Move report_status() into lib/functions.sh as we'll need it in more places
    than just process-package.
  * Move "run needed" policy from process-package to bin/debci. With this,
    debci-test can be called manually at any time to retry tests or get called
    by e. g. britney which already evaluates when to run tests. Remove the
    "run test at most once a day" check completely as package updates can
    happen several times a day. As a by-product this also fixes debci's -f
    option to force a test run.
  * backends/schroot/list-dependencies: Ignore individual apt-get failures as
    that gets called for binaries which don't exist on the selected
    architecture. Fixes operation for e. g. glib2.0.
  * Use chdist instead of the local schroot for package queries:
    - Add scripts/setup-chdist to create/update a chdist for the selected
      release.
    - Use that in list-dependencies instead of querying the schroot. Move that
      script to scripts/ as it is now not backend specific any more.
    - Update lib/functions.sh to use chdist instead of the schroot.
    - Add devscripts dependency for chdist, and demote schroot dependency to
      recommends.
    This allows us to use other backends, like QEMU or remote ones.
  * Reorganize data directory:
    - Split out autopkgtest output into ${debci_data_dir}/autopkgtest/:
      This now contains a full directory for each test run with all of
      adt-run's --output-dir files. This provides access to individual test
      stdout/err logs, the package version lists, and additional artifacts
      that tests produce. With this, autopkgtest/ becomes eligible for being
      on a remote file system and can be synced/rebuilt independently of the
      metadata.
    - Use run IDs with format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS[machine or tags] instead of the
      old YYYYMMDD-n as the former works for a distributed file system and
      remote workers.
    - base.txt is now replaced with adt-run's testbed-packages output file.
    - test-packages.txt gets dropped as there is no need to keep it around
      permanently. Build it from the per-test -packages logs from adt-run.
    - Move status.json into status/ directory and remove the redundant
      latest.json.
    - Move packages.json into status/ directory.
  * Add tools/convert-data: Convert data/ directory to changed format from
    above. This can be dropped again after running it on the production debci
    instance.
  * app.js: Filter out query strings from URL for constructing the .json URLs.
    Fixes wrong URLs after using the package search field.
  * backends/schroot/test-package: Drop unused temporary dir.
  * backends/*/test-package: Write exit code into "exitcode" file in output
    dir, so that we retain it even when we switch to asynchronous/remote
    processing.
  * backends/fake/test-package: Write log file into output dir, like adt-run.
  * Move test result evaluation, log and meta data creation from debci-test to
    debci-generate-indexes. This prepares the way for running adt-run
    asynchronously or remotely, and picking up the results from the
    autopkgtest/ data directory.
  * Reduce the per-test run <timestamp>.log files to the debci metadata
    (triggers, package versions, package diffs, overall result), as the actual
    autopkgtest log is now kept in data/*/autopkgtest/. This avoids
    duplicating the log contents.
  * app.js: In the per-package test list, add link to latest autopkgtest log
    and artifacts (other output files).
  * debci-status --all: Output a list also if there is only one package.
  * debci-status --all: Sort package names so that they appear sorted in the
    web UI.
  * Avoid some error messages noise when calling generate-index without any
    existing test data.
  * Drop debci-test --reason option and make debci-batch put the reason into
    the status directory directly.
  * Fold debci-cleanup into debci-generate-index.

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * schroot backend: pass --session-id to adt-virt-schroot. This makes it
    easier to debug test suite that leave rogue schroot sessions behind.
  * rename `debci` binary to `debci-batch`. `debci` stays reserved for
    providing a entry point binary like `git` that will invoke subcommands
    that are kept out of $PATH to avoid cluttering the namespace.
  * debci-batch: make batch locking suite- and architecture-specific
  * debci-batch: add --offline and --online options. --offline will prevent
    new test runs from being started, and --online will revert to normal
    operation.
  * Rename scripts/*:
    - scripts/process-package: absorbed by the previously almost empty
      bin/debci-test
    - scripts/list-dep8-packages: absorbed by the previously almost empty
      bin/debci-list-packages
    - scripts/list-dependencies  → bin/debci-list-dependencies
    - scripts/setup-chdist       → bin/debci-setup-chdist
    - scripts/blame              → bin/debci-blame
    - scripts/cleanup            → bin/debci-cleanup
    - scripts/generate-index     → bin/debci-generate-index
  * add `debci` binary to not clutter the namespace. When you call `debci
    COMMAND` it will set PATH to include the debci bin/ and then call
    `debci-COMMAND` with the supplied arguments.
  * debci-blame: replace usage of deprecated IO#lines method with IO#each_line
  * debci-generate-index: accept duration as command line switch
  * backends/schroot/create-testbed: drop usage of eatmydata to avoid breaking
    test suites that actually depend on a real fsync(). To compensate the
    performance loss when installing packages, set dpkg `--force-unsafe-io`
    option in a configuration file (Closes: #747308).
  * Added Ruby bindings and the corresponding documentation
  * Dropped usage of faketime in the test suite (Closes: #747715)
  * backends/fake: output a timestamp like the ones adt-run outputs
  * Added new debci-config, a helper to output value of debci configuration
    values
  * debci-generate-feeds: added generation of per-package and global Atom
    feeds. Called from debci-batch
  * public: now using FontAwesome from fonts-font-awesome package
  * public/app.js: add a link to the per-package Atom feed
  * public/style.css: make the status indicators use FontAwesome icons

debci (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * scripts/process-package: skip blame check without a dependencies diff
  * lib/*.sh: guard `set -eu` to avoid doing that on interactive shells
  * lib/functions.sh: fix list_binaries to work against the sources index
    - This fixes listing binaries coming from packages that were binNMUed

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Sat, 05 Apr 2014 20:03:22 -0300

debci (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * etc/schroot/debci/fstab: improve schroot isolation
    - do not share /tmp with host
    - mount tmpfs at /dev/shm as quite some software needs it
  * test_shell_best_practices.sh: skip when checkbashisms is not available.
    - You don't want to install devscripts and all its dependencies when
      running as-installed tests
    - checking for best practices is only useful in development environments.
  * Use unified diff in "Change in the base system since last run"
  * debian/source/options: fix to include publib/data in the source tarball,
    but not data/*

debci (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add missing dctrl-tools dependency.
  * Use "dpkg --print-architecture" instead of dpkg-architecture, to avoid a
    dependency on dpkg-dev and the (undeclared) dependency on gcc.
  * Fix grep_packages() to actually use the configured architecture instead of
    the host architecture.
  * Add --help output to debci-{list-packages,setup,test}, instead of failing
    with an "usage: not found" error.

  [ Antonio Terceiro ]
  * Initial upload to Debian (Closes: #736416)
    The API is not set yet, but I am uploading anyway to allow for early
    testing, improve contribution opportunities, to get a BTS etc.
  * Updated documentation
    - instructions for setting up a development instance.
    - Point traffic at debian-qa
  * modularize behaviour of a backend
    - existing implementation extracted as the `schroot` backend
    - added a `fake` backend that helps with testing
  * schroot backend optimization: always run with eatmydata
  * Add blame support: when tests of a package start failing after some
    dependencies were updated, those dependencies will be "blamed" for the
    failure.
  * improvements on autopkgtest usage:
    - debci now uses the autopkgtest support for downloading the source
      package instead of downloading manually and them calling adt-run
    - debci now differentiates between the non-zero adt-run exit codes, so
      that skipped tests will not count as failures. Also added a `tmpfail`
      status, to be used when for some reason the tests could not be run for
      some external failure (e.g. mirror failures, broken dependencies etc).
  * debci now keeps track of the base system. Tests will be run again every 2
    weeks even if no explicit dependency changes. Test logs will also display
    the changes in the base system since the last run.
  * Add DEP-8 support to debci itself \o/
  * extra safety: add `set -u` to all shell scripts

debci (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Package renamed to debci
  * Require a newer autopkgtest.
    - In general we should always be using a backport of the most recent
      version in unstable.
  * Visual facelift
    - embedding a copy of bootstrap 3 for now :-(
  * Add backend support for multiple architectures. For now unstable/amd64 is
    hardcoded, but reading them from the command line or from the environment
    will not require a large change.
