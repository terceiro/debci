Description: continuous integration system for Debian
 debci will scan the Debian archive for packages that contain DEP-8 compliant
 test suites, and run those test suites whenever a new version of the package,
 or of any package in its dependency chain (modulo the base system), is
 available.
 .
 The requests are distributed to worker machines through AMQP queues. You need
 rabbitmq-server for this; but it is also possible to run RabbitMQ on a
 different server than debci, in which case you do not need to install that
 recommendation.
 .
 This package contains the debci core.

Description: continuous integration system for Debian (worker daemon)

 This package provides cron and init integration for running debci worker
 daemons that will listen to AMQP queues and run test jobs.

Description: continuous integration system for Debian (collector daemon)
 debci will scan the Debian archive for packages that contain DEP-8 compliant
 test suites, and run those test suites whenever a new version of the package,
 or of any package in its dependency chain (modulo the base system), is
 available.
 .
 The requests are distributed to worker machines through AMQP queues. You need
 rabbitmq-server for this; but it is also possible to run RabbitMQ on a
 different server than debci, in which case you do not need to install that
 recommendation.
 .
 This package provides the collector daemon, which will receive test results
 published by debci worker hosts, store them centrally, and generate the static
 HTML files for the debci user interface.
